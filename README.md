### Hi 👋, This project is just basic and focus on

- 👌 &nbsp; JavaScript -> Learn from it then makes me feel exicted about learning Angular & React 🤩

- 😁 &nbsp; HTML : practice with local storage and some basic tag.

- 🔥 &nbsp; CSS : use CSS invalid sector 😆.

<hr>

Just a recommend: It should be opened by Visual studio code with live server to run.

<p>This is my first project with Javascript, so it's just tiny project 🥺. But hoping u enjoy it 🥰</p>
